  Generative AI is a groundbreaking and rapidly advancing type of artificial intelligence that can formulate new content through machine learning models. Playing a major role in multiple
  industries such as education, creative arts and design, its ability to generate large bodies of text, images, code and other content offers new opportunities. To enhance organisation, 
  further productivity, and enrich problem-solving. Both students and schools use generative ai, whether it be for admin, lesson planning or personalised learning for students. However, 
  benefits aside, the question arises: how far can generative ai be used in education before it becomes damaging for students? Students and teachers could form a dependency on AI that 
  could undermine critical thinking, restrict creativity, and violate ethical concerns such as misinformation and plagiarism. This essay explores the fine line between the practicality 
  and overdependence on generative AI.

  Positives of AI
  Let us begin with the positive implications of the use of generative AI. There are multiple studies that reinforce the idea that generative AI may be more beneficial than traditional methods. 
  For instance, the study of The Qualitative Analysis of the Efficacy of the AR-Classroom was an experiment where two sets of students were split into those using the application and those using 
  a physical prop. The AR-Classroom app is an immersive technology that can be used to recreate real world experiences and elevates learning. The results of this experiment showed students having 
  more confidence when solving the problems, with the aid of the AR-Classroom whereas the set of students without the program, relied on their resources and notes rather than their physical prop.
  The app allowed students to visualise abstract concepts and handle complex spatial relationships and the study mentions that this was a hole in the students' learning and an area for improvement. 
  The experiment was carried out fairly and thoroughly with tests done beforehand, video recordings and notes made, making it a reliable source of data. It misses qualitative data, however, which 
  could make the experiment more accurate. Overall, this study supports the idea of the utility of AI in consolidating student’s understanding of intricate problems.

  Negatives of AI
  To contrast my last point, there are also classic examples of where a student's overuse of generative AI can be harmful. This is evident in the case of a Qualitative study of a student's experience
  of using ChatGPT. In this article, students described the tool for the ‘lazy learner’ and that it is enticing to use. Other students also felt that it was unfair for their peers to achieve similar
  grades with less effort and hard work which leads to a source of demotivation. Generative AI like ChatGPT can negatively impact students by fostering dependency, reducing critical thinking, and 
  oversimplifying learning. While its immediacy and efficiency in summarizing content or generating ideas may be beneficial, these shortcuts seem to lead students to rely too heavily on AI for answers. 
  This prevents the student from a true understanding of their studies and denies them from the trial and error and mistakes that would develop their learning. Not only does the use of AI harm other 
  students but AI assistance could lead to academic misconduct and damage the student’s learning record and the fate of their degree.

  How should it be used?
  Generative AI offers immense potential and opportunities for enhancing education when used responsibly and under teacher or professor supervision. Under teacher guidance, AI tools can complement 
  traditional methods, while ensuring students engage with the learning materials while avoiding the misuse of AI. Teachers can actively monitor the usage to prevent academic misconduct while it assists 
  students in brainstorming, summarising complex ideas and makes learning more accessible. Specifically, the paper “The promises and challenges of generative AI in education” (Giannakos Michail et al 2024), 
  highlights how AI use can be useful for teachers to identify the holes in students' learning and the common challenges they are facing, which in turn shapes how teachers can approach their class for the 
  best outcome. Whether it be they target a small group of people at a time or provide feedback for the whole class. Small decisions like these can make a big difference in the student’s improvement and 
  understanding of their mistakes. This study shows how generative AI can be used for improving learning rather than a replacement for genuine intellectual effort. 

  This paper explored the effects and consequences of using generative AI in the development of young adult’s learning. After exploring different cases and studies, the use of AI is shown to have its benefits 
  and drawbacks. While AI grants immediate aid and clarification for students, the unmonitored use of it can lead to multiple problems which harm learning rather than further it. In conclusion, generative AI 
  should be used under supervision in classrooms and tutorials where teachers deem it practical.
