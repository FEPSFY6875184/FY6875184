  Generative AI is a groundbreaking and rapidly advancing type of artificial intelligence that can formulate new content through machine learning models. Playing a major role in multiple
  industries such as education, creative arts and design, its ability to generate large bodies of text, images, code and other content offers new opportunities. To enhance organisation, 
  further productivity, and enrich problem-solving. Both students and schools use generative ai, whether it be for admin, lesson planning or personalised learning for students. However, 
  benefits aside, the question arises: how far can generative ai be used in education before it becomes damaging for students? Students and teachers could form a dependency on AI that 
  could undermine critical thinking, restrict creativity, and violate ethical concerns such as misinformation and plagiarism. This essay explores the fine line between the practicality 
  and overdependence on generative AI.

Let us begin with the positive implications of the use of generative AI. There are multiple studies that reinforce the idea that generative AI may be more beneficial than traditional methods. 
For instance, the study of The Qualitative Analysis of the Efficacy of the AR-Classroom was an experiment where two sets of students were split into those using the application and those using 
a physical prop. The AR-Classroom app is an immersive technology that can be used to recreate real world experiences and elevates learning. The results of this experiment showed students having 
more confidence when solving the problems, with the aid of the AR-Classroom whereas the set of students without the program, relied on their resources and notes rather than their physical prop.
The app allowed students to visualise abstract concepts and handle complex spatial relationships and the study mentions that this was a hole in the students' learning and an area for improvement. 
The experiment was carried out fairly and thoroughly with tests done beforehand, video recordings and notes made, making it a reliable source of data. It misses qualitative data, however, which 
could make the experiment more accurate. Overall, this study supports the idea of the utility of AI in consolidating student’s understanding of intricate problems.
