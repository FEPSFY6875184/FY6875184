  Generative AI is a groundbreaking and rapidly advancing type of artificial intelligence that can formulate new content through machine learning models. Playing a major role in multiple industries such as education, creative arts and design, its ability to generate
  large bodies of text, images, code and other content offers new opportunities. To enhance organisation, further productivity, and enrich problem-solving. Both students and schools use generative ai, whether it be for admin, lesson planning or personalised learning
  for students. However, benefits aside, the question arises: how far can generative ai be used in education before it becomes damaging for students? Students and teachers could form a dependency on AI that could undermine critical thinking, restrict creativity, and 
  violate ethical concerns such as misinformation and plagiarism. This essay explores the fine line between the practicality and overdependence on 
  generative AI.
